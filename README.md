INTRODUCTON

Performance analysis is a critical process for any business, as it provides insights into the operational efficiency, financial health, and overall success of the organization. For Rocciniati Superstore, a comprehensive performance analysis from 2011 to 2014 will help identify trends, strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

DATA CLEANING

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and some precautions were taken even though the dataset was clean. Some of these precautions taken were;

Ensuring absence of empty rows.
Ensuring absence of duplicated rows.
Ensuring the date entries are standardized to a uniform date format.
STANDARD EXCEL TABLE: The dataset was transformed to a standard excel table for easier management and automation.

Pre-Analysis Board
I conducted a pre-analysis process on the dataset before analyzing the dataset on pivot chart. This pre-analysis involves breaking the dataset into meaningful components.

Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.
Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing when the analysis starts proper.
Potential Insights: I was able too uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.
Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.
